#HTTP - HYPERTEXT TRANSFER PROTOCOL

##What is HTTP? 


HTTP is an acronym for Hypertext Transfer Protocol, literally a protocol used to transfer hypertext. What is a protocol and what is hypertext? In this context, a protocol is a system of rules that allow communication of information between different entities, like computers. Hypertext is a somewhat outdated word for text that is displayed on a computer screen that contains hyperlinks to other text. A hypertext transfer protocol is the set of rules, servers and browsers used to transfer web documents back and forth. Which is why every URL you type into a web browser starts with http. Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is one of the most utilized protocols on the internet.

##PRINCIPLES OF HTTP

1. ###It is written in plain language and human readable
A HTTP request, response or message can be read and can easily be understood even if you don't necessarily know how the technology works. All HTTP request methods use simple human language verbs such as Get, post, put, delete etc.

2. ###HTTP is a stateless protocol
HTTP as a stateless protocol means each individual request sent over the protocol is unique, and no request is connected to another request. HTTP has no memory of previous requests.

3. ###HTTP works based on request/response pairs. 
Every action performed over HTTP starts with a request using one of the HTTP methods and ends with a response containing an HTTP status code saying what happened to the request along with the data like headers and content.
